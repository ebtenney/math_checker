Here's how to solve this problem using the method of cylindrical shells:

**1. Visualize the Region:**

The region is bounded by the curve $y = \sqrt{5x^2} = x\sqrt{5}$ (since x is non-negative in the given interval), the x-axis ($y=0$), and the lines $x=0$ and $x=2$.  This forms a triangle-like region in the first quadrant.

**2. Set up the Integral:**

The method of cylindrical shells involves integrating along the x-axis (since we're rotating about the y-axis).  The volume of a cylindrical shell is given by $2\pi x h \Delta x$, where:

* $2\pi x$ is the circumference of the shell.
* $h$ is the height of the shell (which is the y-value of the curve).
* $\Delta x$ is the thickness of the shell.

In this case, the height of each shell is $h = y = x\sqrt{5}$.  The radius of each shell is simply x.  The limits of integration are from $x=0$ to $x=2$.  Therefore, the integral representing the volume is:

$V = \int_{0}^{2} 2\pi x (x\sqrt{5}) dx$

**3. Evaluate the Integral:**

$V = 2\pi \sqrt{5} \int_{0}^{2} x^2 dx$

$V = 2\pi \sqrt{5} \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{0}^{2}$

$V = 2\pi \sqrt{5} \left( \frac{2^3}{3} - \frac{0^3}{3} \right)$

$V = 2\pi \sqrt{5} \left( \frac{8}{3} \right)$

$V = \frac{16\pi\sqrt{5}}{3}$


Therefore, the volume generated by rotating the region about the y-axis is $\frac{16\pi\sqrt{5}}{3}$ cubic units.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{16\pi\sqrt{5}/3}$
