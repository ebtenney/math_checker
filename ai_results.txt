Here's how to solve this problem using the method of cylindrical shells:

**1. Understand the Region:**

We're rotating the region bounded by  \(y = \sqrt{5+x^2}\), \(y = 0\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 2\) around the y-axis.  This region is a portion of a circle with radius \(\sqrt{5}\) in the first quadrant, extending from \(x=0\) to \(x=2\).

**2. Set up the Integral:**

The method of cylindrical shells uses the formula:

\(V = 2\pi \int_{a}^{b} x f(x) \, dx\)

where:

* \(V\) is the volume.
* \(a\) and \(b\) are the limits of integration (in this case, 0 and 2).
* \(x\) is the radius of a cylindrical shell.
* \(f(x)\) is the height of a cylindrical shell (which is the y-value of the curve).


In our case, \(f(x) = \sqrt{5+x^2}\).  Therefore, the integral becomes:

\(V = 2\pi \int_{0}^{2} x \sqrt{5+x^2} \, dx\)

**3. Solve the Integral:**

We can solve this integral using substitution:

Let \(u = 5 + x^2\). Then \(du = 2x \, dx\), and \(x \, dx = \frac{1}{2} du\).

When \(x = 0\), \(u = 5\).
When \(x = 2\), \(u = 5 + 2^2 = 1\).

The integral transforms to:

\(V = 2\pi \int_{5}^{1} \sqrt{u} \left(-\frac{1}{2} du\right) = \pi \int_{1}^{5} u^{1/2} \, du\)

Now integrate:

\(V = \pi \left[ \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \right]_{1}^{5} = \pi \left( \frac{2}{3} (5^{3/2} - 1^{3/2}) \right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} (5\sqrt{5} - 1)\)

**4. Final Answer:**

The volume generated by rotating the region about the y-axis is:

\(V = \frac{2\pi}{3} (5\sqrt{5} - 1)\) cubic units.
